/** 8.9 The Completion Specification Type
    The Completion type is used to explain the behaviour of statements (break, continue, return and throw)
    that perform nonlocal transfers of control. Values of the Completion type are triples of the
    form (type, value, target), where type is one of normal, break, continue, return, or throw, value is any
    ECMAScript language value or empty, and target is any ECMAScript identifier or empty.
    If cv is a completion value then cv.type, cv.value, and cv.target may be used to directly refer to its constituent values.

    The term "abrupt completion" refers to any completion with a type other than normal.

    returned. The calling algorithms are also terminated, until an algorithm step is reached that explicitly deals
    with the exception, using terminology such as "If an exception was thrown...". Once such an algorithm step
